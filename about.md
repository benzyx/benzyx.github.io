Hello! I'm Ben. Online, I go by `benzy` or `kuroba`.

I'm a computer science enthusiast, interested in algorithms, deep learning, and computer systems. My favorite projects involve developing algorithms to play games, such as MIT's Battlecode, or Dominion. I write software in C++ and Python, but recently I'm experimenting with Rust and Julia.

As of August 2020, I work at Hudson River Trading, developing algorithms that trade on the market.

I studied Computer Science, Combinatorics and Optimizaton at the University of Waterloo. During university, I was heavily involved in the Waterloo Data Science Club, and the Canadian competitive programming scene.

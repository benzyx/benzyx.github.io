Today I'm moving to New York with my girlfriend. It's a bittersweet feeling. After 5 months of isolating with my family during the pandemic, it's hard to leave. During university, my parents and my brother didn't get to see me very often. The last few months has been a surreal experience, but I really bonded with family. I'll miss them, and hopefully I'll get to see them soon.

Now, I'm excited for future adventures in a new city.

It's been a year since I started working full time. During 5 years of school, I never stayed in one place too long, moving from city to city every four months. Thanks Waterloo. As a result of staying in one place for a full year, this past year felt like the fastest year in my life so far, despite day-to-day life in NYC being more exciting than my life in school.

Today, I listened to Kanye West's Ghost Town (or rather, this [fan-made remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQAsaY0pKhI)) and it instantly reminded me of my time in Seattle in the summer of 2018. It's incredible how many old memories hearing this song can bring back, and how vividly I can remember it all: riding the ORCA in the morning from Capitol Hill to 2nd St., riding the skeletal elevator up Smith tower, walking to a coffee shop around downtown Seattle for team coffee every afternoon.

I went through a few other albums that trigger my nostalgia to a specific set of experiences. Frank Ocean's Blonde is the next biggest example, which came out in summer of 2016. When I lived in the Mission that fall, I would put this album on from the start as I left the house towards the 24th Street BART station. Nikes, the first song of the album, can make me remember exactly what stores I passed by on that route.

Trying to find albums for some other internships, I realized that while music might not give strong associations, I can vividly remember the audiobooks I listened to, and somtimes, where I was as I listened to particular chapters. When I was at Citadel in 2017, the two audiobooks I really remember are Misbehaving, and Thinking Fast and Slow. Misbehaving reminds me of the few late nights at the office where I listened to it while I worked, especially the chapters about Loss Aversion. When I put on the first chapters of Thinking Fast and Slow, I immediately remember being on the treadmill at my apartment as I tried out the book, and can even trace my thoughts about how my System 2 can't keep up with the book when I try to jog at a 6.

I'm kind of happy that my brain is capable of this. It's nice to relive the past, albeit selectively, through these audio triggers.

Here's a map of a few of these examples:
- Forest Hills Drive -> 2015 First year Waterloo
- Blond -> Yelp 2016
- Pablo -> Yelp 2016
- Running in the 90's -> Facebook 2017
- Thinking Fast and Slow (Audiobook) -> Citadel 2018
- Misbehaving (Audiobook) -> Citadel 2018
- Ye -> MemSQL 2018
- Shoe Dog (Audiobook) -> Hiking in Seattle 2018
- Path to Power (Audiobook) -> Walking to class in Waterloo 2020.
- Most audiobooks actually map to something. Probably because they're unique?

At first, I couldn't find anything for Facebook 2017. As I tried to hunt for examples, I remembered that I created a playlist on Spotify during this internship, that I played at work often, called (Gotta Code Faster)[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/71fkmteVdFC2PWHC10w8J9?si=3c54acbf24b34be4]. The moment it started, and Running in the 90's hit, I remembered the few days before the midterm review when I was catching up on weeks of work on Caffe2.

I suspect the 4-month internship template is a huge contributing factor for this association. I usually spam albums for 1-2 months, and so large chunk of this unique 4-month experience is correlated with these albums, that I usually won't play much after my obsessions with them are done. Kanye's Graduation (specifically Homecoming), is a song that I played all the time in Chicago. But I don't have as strong feelings about it now, perhaps because I was in Chicago in two different internships, over a year apart? Or maybe I'm just overthinking it. 

I hope one day I'll associate a particular album to this last year of my life. But I doubt it. Maybe life is just going to be a blur from now on: being in one place for a long time, falling into a routine that outlives any album or audiobook, until eventually years just get compressed into one "state". It would really suck if in the future, I start associating music to years at a time, instead of 4 months chunks.

Anyway, it's 4AM. I shouldn't have coffee at night.
